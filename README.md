# balanceSheet
Program to create a balance sheet for my Foundations of Accounting class

I created this program for my Accounting class to assist me in creating accounting frameworks.
This program keeps running totals of several assets and liabilities that are printed out at termination.
I have left several opportunities for code condensation, especially the elimination of the many if/else statements. However, as this program was able to serve it's original purpose, I did not get around to optimizing the program. 

Hope you enjoy, and thank you for your time!
